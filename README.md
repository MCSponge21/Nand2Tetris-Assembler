# Nand2Tetris-Assembler
This is my solution for the Nand2Tetris basic assembler from project 6. It takes a .asm file with machine language written in it and does a one-to-one transfer of the machine code into binary for the computer to execute. The binary code is written into a new file called binary.hack, which is the file you input into the Nand2Tetris website for code evaluation. It utilises a two-pass approach, the first pass for only adding labels, the lines that start and end with parenthesis used for declaring loops, into the symbol table. The second pass is used for finding variables, the ones that start with the @ symbol, and converting their value into the memory address associated with that variable. The symbol table has pre-defined symbols that are specifically designed for the hack computer that I am building with the Nand2Tetris project. This solution completely passed every test .asm file on the website, including the 28,000 line pong game. Try it out for yourself.
